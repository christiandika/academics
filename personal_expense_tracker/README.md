# ðŸ§¾ Personal Expense Tracker

## Overview
The **Personal Expense Tracker** is a Python-based console application designed to help users manage their daily expenses, categorize spending, and track budgets effectively.  
It supports saving and loading expense data from a CSV file, allowing users to maintain a persistent record across sessions.

> **Python version:** The code was executed and tested with **Python 3.12.10**.

---

## Objectives
This project aims to:
1. Enable users to **log daily expenses** with date, category, amount, and description.
2. Allow categorization of expenses (e.g., Food, Travel, Groceries, etc.).
3. Support **budget tracking** against user-defined monthly limits.
4. Implement **file handling** for saving and loading expenses.
5. Provide a simple **interactive, menu-driven interface**.

## Features

### 1. Add Expense
Users can add a new expense by entering:
- **Date:** Must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (current or past date).
- **Category:** Selected from a predefined list of categories (e.g., Housing, Transportation, Health, etc.).
- **Amount:** Must be a positive number.
- **Description:** A short text (max 100 characters).

Each expense is saved automatically into the local CSV file (`expense_database.csv`) and stored in memory as a dictionary:
```python
{'date': '2025-04-06', 'category': 'Transportation', 'amount': 55.82, 'description': 'Gas fill-up for car'}
```

---

### 2. View Expenses
Displays all recorded expenses from memory or file, formatted with clear field labels:
```
date: 2025-04-06  category: Transportation  amount: 55.82  description: Gas fill-up for car
```
Incomplete or invalid entries are automatically skipped or flagged.

---

### 3. Set Monthly Budget
Users can set a **monthly budget** for the current or previous year.  
Input required:
- Year (`YYYY`)
- Month (numeric 1â€“12)
- Budget amount

Budgets are stored in a dictionary:
```python
BUDGETS = {
    "2025": {"Apr": 1500.00, "May": 1200.00}
}
```

---

### 4. Track Budget
Calculates the **total expenses** for a given month and compares them with the defined budget:
- Displays total expenses and remaining balance.
- Warns the user if the budget is exceeded.

Example output:
```
Period: 2025 Apr
Budget: 1500.0
Total Expenses: 1472.50
Your remaining balance is $27.50
```

---

### 5. Save and Load Expenses
- **Load:** Automatically loads previously saved expenses from `expense_database.csv` at program start.
- **Save:** Each expense is written to file immediately after creation, ensuring no data loss.

CSV structure:
```
Date,Category,Amount,Description
2025-04-05,Housing,682.42,Home insurance premium
2025-04-06,Transportation,55.82,Gas fill-up
```

---

### 6. Interactive Menu
A text-based menu lets users navigate the application:
```
What would you like to do next?
1 : Add expense
2 : View expenses
3 : Track budget
4 : Set budget
5 : Exit
```
