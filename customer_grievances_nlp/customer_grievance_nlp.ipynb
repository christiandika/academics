      "on XX/XX/XX22 I opened a safe balance account online using my payroll check of over {$600.00} as my account opener. On XX/XX/XX22, I attempted to login to my app and received a \" account locked contact customer service @ XXXX '' error message. I placed the call and was told I would have to go to a branch to verify my identity, which I did. At the same time, I was told I had a positive balance of of {$650.00} and could make a withdrawal from the teller, which I did for {$400.00} leaving a balance of + {$250.00}. Shortly after that, I deposited a mobile check for {$5XX.00}. On XX/XX/XX22, again I attempted to login and received the previous error message along with 3 emails stating a hold was placed on my account. Contacting the same previous number I was told that my acct was being closed by the Risk Dept. due to lack of identity verification, which I told them I had done the day before. I was then told it didn't matter the account was already being closed and it was not reversible, so I asked about my balance and was then told I was overdrawn by {$400.00} and I would have to pay that before I could be set up with a new acct. None of this makes logically sense, nor does it in anyway seem legal. I have contacted my attorney who suggested that I attempt to resolve the issue with a supervisor or manager before he makes any court filings so that is what I am doing now. All of this has not just caused me unnecessary stress but put myself and my family into serious financial hardship and suffering. We were force to miss XXXX with family due to lack of funds to travel, I have no way to pay for the propane that is for cooking and heating my home, my mortgage payment, car registration and insurance are now all past due resulting in late fees totalling {$350.00}, all caused by poorly trained bank employees!\n",
